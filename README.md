Automatic HTML indentation plugin for Sublime Text 2

*This plugin is still in alpha version*

This plugin intends to provide an HTML indentation feature for Sublime Text 2 based on the one from Dreamweaver. It comes with a configuration file where you can set behaviours specifically for each tag (line-break: before, after and inside; and contents: formatted and indented).

To trigger the auto indentation, use CMD + K, M on Macs (or CTRL + K, M on Windows machines)
